### Colors

> Color hierarchy is based on material; in other words, this color scheme is simplified material.

Color palette has follow types of colors:

- __primary:__ is the color displayed most frequently across your app's screens and components; can
  also be used to accent elements, if you don’t have a secondary color;
- __onPrimary:__ typography placed on _primary_;
- __secondary:__ is used to accent select parts of your UI; it can be complementary or analogous to
  your primary color, but it should not simply be a light or dark variation of your primary color;
- __onSecondary:__ typography placed on _secondary_;
- __background:__ appears behind scrollable content;
- __onBackground:__ typography placed on _background_;
- __surface:__ affect surfaces of components, such as cards, sheets, and menus.
- __onSurface:__ typography placed on _surface_.

Use cases:

- __primary:__ accent and brand colors;
- __onPrimary:__ all text-based ui elements which are located on _primary_;
- __secondary:__ buttons, text fields, text sections, progress bars, links, headlines, etc;
- __onSecondary:__ all text-based ui elements which are located on _secondary_;
- __background:__ ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
- __onBackground:__ all text-based ui elements which are located on _background_;
- __surface:__ cards and other containers placed on _background_;
- __onSurface:__ all text-based ui elements which are located on _surface_.
